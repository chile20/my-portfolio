# Building Scalable Web Applications with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building modern web applications. In this post, I'll share my experience building scalable applications that serve thousands of users.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features that make it ideal for scalable applications:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improved SEO and faster initial page loads
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-render pages at build time for maximum performance
3. **API Routes** - Build your backend and frontend in the same codebase
4. **Image Optimization** - Automatic image optimization with the `next/image` component
5. **Code Splitting** - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Use Static Generation When Possible

Static generation is the fastest way to serve content. Use `getStaticProps` for pages that can be pre-rendered:

\`\`\`typescript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData();

  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60, // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  };
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Implement Incremental Static Regeneration

ISR allows you to update static pages without rebuilding the entire site:

\`\`\`typescript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: { /* ... */ },
    revalidate: 3600, // Revalidate every hour
  };
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Optimize Images

Always use the Next.js Image component for automatic optimization:

\`\`\`tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero image"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority
/>
\`\`\`

## Real-World Example: CSU Dashboard

At CSU System Operations, we built a dashboard serving 10,000+ users using these principles:

- **Performance**: Reduced page load times by 40% through code splitting and lazy loading
- **Scalability**: Handled peak loads of 2,000+ concurrent users
- **SEO**: Achieved 95+ Lighthouse scores across all metrics

## Conclusion

Next.js provides powerful tools for building scalable web applications. By following these best practices and optimization strategies, you can create fast, reliable applications that scale with your user base.

## Key Takeaways

- Use static generation whenever possible for maximum performance
- Implement ISR for dynamic content that needs frequent updates
- Optimize images and use code splitting to reduce bundle sizes
- Monitor performance metrics and iterate based on real-world data

Happy coding!
